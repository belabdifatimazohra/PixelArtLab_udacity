Pixel Art Maker
You create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

1- Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2- Choose a color.
3- Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
